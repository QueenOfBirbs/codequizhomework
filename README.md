screenshots:
these are located in the finished folder on the repo, they show the start page, a question page and the highscore page!

acceptance criteria:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

what i actually got accomplished:
- a playable quiz that goes through multiple questions
- a start button that starts said quiz
- a proper timer that takes away time everytime an answer is marked incorrectly
- a highscores page with an input box and buttons but not actually able to store user intials and their score yet

other notes:
i feel really proud of this one! everything may not work perfectly but i feel like i got majority of what was needed in their and just need some help connecting it all. overall it was really fun to test out my new skills and show off some of my older ones again.
