# Code Quiz Homework

## Description 

Here is a link to the deployed application on Github:

This is a finished homework assignment from the beginning of the bootcamp course. Though a little rough compared to my later works, I'm still quite fond of the CSS on it as it was challenging for me at the time it was made.
